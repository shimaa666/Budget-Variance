ðŸš€ Project Spotlight: Variance Analysis Report in Power BI ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project where my team and I developed an in-depth Variance Analysis Report using Power BI. This dashboard provides valuable insights into our sales performance, comparing actual sales against budgeted targets across various products and time periods.

Key Highlights:

Total Budget: $45.91M
Total Actual Sales: $45.72M
Overall Variance: -$193.22K (-0.42%)
Product Insights:

Aspen: Underperformed by $281,247 (-1.56%)
Carlota: Surpassed the budget with a positive variance of $73,222 (+0.48%)
Quad: Nearly aligned with a slight positive variance of $14,801 (+0.12%)
Process & Visuals:

Utilized bar charts, line graphs, and KPI indicators to present performance metrics clearly.
Followed a structured process of Data Profiling, Cleaning, Processing, Analysis, and Visualization to ensure accuracy and clarity.
A huge thank you to my amazing team: Shimaa Sayed, Rama, and Ehab, for their collaboration and hard work. Also, special gratitude to my instructor Yasser A. Rahman for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project.

Together, weâ€™ve created a tool that not only enhances our decision-making process but also highlights the power of data-driven insights.
